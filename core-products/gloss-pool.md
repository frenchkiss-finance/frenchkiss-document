# GLOSS Pool

**Imagine:**

1. You STAKE your KISS to get GLOSS
2. Now you are earning a portion of 25% of each block reward
3. Now you stake that GLOSS and start earning tokens from brand new BSC projects

This is galaxy mega brain KISS compounding.

Your KISS is now pulling in **multiple** income streams.

Sounds‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsweet‚Äù, right? üòè

**GLOSS Pool: where sweet, new tokens meet the FrenchKiss Finance community!**

Gloss Pool allows Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to GLOSS token holders.

Gloss Pool will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the FrenchKiss Finance team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Gloss Pool but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since FrenchKiss Finance has had the [fairest launch ever](https://medium.com/@frenchkissfinance/the-fairest-launch-ever-5b246644ba2a), GLOSS Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the largest \(and most active\) BSC community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the FrenchKiss Finance interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).

**Extending the utility of GLOSS tokens**

Governance, collecting fees, stacking KISS block rewards‚Ä¶ for now.

With GLOSS Pool, a new function has been offered for GLOSS holders in FrenchKiss Finance: adding the toppings to $GLOSS and the $KISS.
